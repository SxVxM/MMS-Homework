			Example 1:
		Case 1:
	You are a guest in a dining room.
	You go to get yourself a plate.
	There are no plates on the table.
	The staff has not finished washing the plates.
	You ask someone for a plate, but there is none so you wait.
	Your request will reach the staff and you will get a plate soon.

		Case 2:
	The staff have finished washing the plates.
	However, there is no space to leave the cleaned plates.
	The table is full of clean plates.
	All people in the room have their plates.
	The staff member has to wait before putting more plates on the table.
	
		Conclusion:
	This way producers can give out as much clean plates as there are customers.
	However, when there are no customers, they have no space for the product.
	The other way around - if the producers do not have enough products,
	consumers will be waiting and requesting product.
	
			Example 2:
	There is a teacher and students in a room.
	There is an exam that is happening.
	Each student has to give their paperwork as soon as they finish.
	All students line up in a queue and give their work to the teacher.
	The teacher has to evaluate and give marks to each student one by one.
	The teacher waited for the students to finish their work.
	Now the students have to wait for the teacher to mark their work.
	
			Example 3:
	Imagine a production line in a factory.
	Each worker gets work and has to complete their work, 
	before giving it out to the next one.
	Each worker in the procution line is a producer for the following one and so on.
	The following worker has to wait fot the previous one to finish work.
